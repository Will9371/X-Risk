  narrative: AI is a hugely valuable tool, but it also has potential dangers.  These
    dangers include certain, near term problems, such as societal disruptions and
    existing systems not working as intended, as well as theoretical, long-term problems,
    such as superintelligent AI systems developing unpredictable goals and destoying
    humanity.  Human misuse of AI is an ongoing risk that becomes more extreme as
    the power of AI increases.
