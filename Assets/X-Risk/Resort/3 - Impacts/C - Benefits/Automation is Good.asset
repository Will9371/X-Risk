  m_Name: Automation is Good
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  narrative: Automation means more accomplished with less work, which is an intrinsically
    good thing.  The challenge is deciding what happens to the resulting surplus. 
    If it is used to concentrate power in the hands of the people who own the means
    of automation, then some people are worse off.  But if the surplus is distributed
    to everyone, then everyone is better off.
