  narrative: Do you claim to know God's plan?  And that it involves humanity destroying
    itself by the careless accident enacted by a few individuals?  Perhaps God's
    plan is that this is our wake-up call, forcing us to rise to the occasion and
    finally learn to work together for the good of all.
