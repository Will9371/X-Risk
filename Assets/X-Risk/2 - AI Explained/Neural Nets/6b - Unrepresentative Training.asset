  narrative: Sometimes the training environment is too different from where the system
    will be used.  For example, if a neural net is trained to distinguish cats from
    dogs, but all the cat pictures are indoors and all the dog pictures are outside,
    then it might instead learn to identify whether the picture is indoors or outdoors. 
    Sometimes, however, the flaws in the training data are more subtle and harder
    to avoid.
