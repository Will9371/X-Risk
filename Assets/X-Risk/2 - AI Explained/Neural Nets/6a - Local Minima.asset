  narrative: One problem is local minima.  Imagine a ball rolling down a hill.  The
    lowest it can go is sea level, but most likely it will stop at the bottom of
    a hole, or some place where every direction around it goes uphill.  The same
    thing happens in ML, the system changes to decrease the error signal, but it
    can easily get stuck with a set of weights and biases that isn't the best configuration,
    but where any small change makes the output worse.
