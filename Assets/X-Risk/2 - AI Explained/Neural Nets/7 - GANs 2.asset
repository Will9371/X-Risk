  narrative: Not yet.  In a GAN, two networks compete with each other.  Let's consider
    an image generator, for example.  One network is a generator, which creates images. 
    The other is a discriminator, which is given a mix of real images (what it is
    trying to imitate, let's say cat photos) and images created by the generator.
