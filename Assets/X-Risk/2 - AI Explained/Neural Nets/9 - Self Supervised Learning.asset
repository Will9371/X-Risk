  narrative: During self-supervised learning, ChatGPT gathers massive amounts of
    text from the internet (indiscriminately, more is better).  Then it takes sections
    of text, redacts part of it, and tries to guess what was redacted.  Since it
    knows the answer, it can use the error for training.  And because the whole process
    is automated, it can get a lot of training data this way.
