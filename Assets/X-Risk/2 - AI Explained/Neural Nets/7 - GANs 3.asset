  narrative: At first, the discriminator guesses at random and fails.  But as it
    gets better, the generator has to improve to continue to fool it, which forces
    the discriminator to continue improving.  Eventually, the generator gets so good
    that there simply is no way for the discriminator to win because the generated
    images look just like the real ones.
