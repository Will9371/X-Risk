  narrative: Machine learning is a technique that allows computers to learn without
    being programmed.  It connects a bunch of artificial neurons together, adjusting
    their weights and biases, to change how inputs are converted to outputs, based
    on an error signal.   "Deep learning" refers to the way the neurons are organized
    into multiple layers.
