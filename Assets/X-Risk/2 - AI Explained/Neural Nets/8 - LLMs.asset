  narrative: ChatGPT uses LLMs (Large Language Models), which have some extra tricks
    compared to other forms of neural-network based AI.  First, it uses transformers
    (the T in GPT), a technique where some layers have much fewer neurons...no one
    knows why that helps, but it helps a lot.  ChatGPT is also trained in a 3-phase
    process including self-supervised learning, finetuning, and RLHF.
