  narrative: ChatGPT has a bunch of extra tricks.  First, it uses transformers (the
    T in GPT), a technique where some layers have much fewer neurons...no one knows
    why that helps, but it helps a lot.  ChatGPT is also trained in a 3-phase process
    including self-supervised learning, finetuning, and RLHF.
