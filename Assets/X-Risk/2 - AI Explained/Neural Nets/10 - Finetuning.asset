  narrative: 'Self-supervised learning gives ChatGPT a general understanding of language,
    but trying to talk to it at this point would give terrible results.  It would
    happily tell you to do illegal things, use hate-speech as freely as the darkest
    depths of 4Chan, and speak in a disturbingly unhumanlike fashion.  Finetuning
    improves the systems'' usability by repeating the self-supervised learning process
    with a smaller, highly curated selection of text data.  This also allows designers
    to shape ChatGPTs "voice" and what sort of answers it prefers to give. '
