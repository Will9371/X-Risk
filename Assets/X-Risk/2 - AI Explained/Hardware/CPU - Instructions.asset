  narrative: Now imagine a bunch of these electrical circuits arranged on a grid.
    Each of them is connected by a switchboard (another basic circuit), so that you
    can send a signal to any one of the circuits by using part of the signal as an
    identifier saying which circuit the rest of the signal should be directed towards.
