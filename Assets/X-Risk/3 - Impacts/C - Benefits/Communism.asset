  m_Name: Communism
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  narrative: Communism is a scary word because totalitarian governments used it to
    justify oppressive regimes.  It is also been ineffective as an economic system
    when applied to many human-run industries.  Capitalism, on the other hand, is
    very good at prompting efficient solutions to complex problems, but tends to
    fail at managing externalized costs.  Pretty much all high-functioning societies
    today use some mixture of captialist and socialist principles, such as private
    industry with social welfare.  Both of these systems, however, center around
    the relationship between owners and workers, and will therefore require rethinking
    in a future where owners don't need workers.
