  narrative: AI has the potential to be a hugely valuable tool, but it also has dangers
    that some people are worried about.  I will refer to attempts to solve near-term
    problems, such as societal disruptions and existing systems not working as intended,
    as "safety" and efforts to prevent long-term problems, like superintelligent
    AI systems destoying humanity, as "alignment".
