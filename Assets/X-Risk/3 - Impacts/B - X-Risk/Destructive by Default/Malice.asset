  narrative: Even if AI remains a tool that empowers people, some people are...not
    nice.  Terrorists could create deadly bioweapons, governments could create vastly
    more effective propaganda, thieves could devise better scams, and whoever owns
    the AI systems could use their position to further concentrate wealth and power
    in the hands of a few...or some idiot might straight-up ask an AI to destroy
    the world.
