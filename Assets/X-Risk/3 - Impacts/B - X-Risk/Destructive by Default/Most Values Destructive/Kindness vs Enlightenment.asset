  m_Name: Kindness vs Enlightenment
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  narrative: Human kindness exists as a consequence of our unique evolutionary history. 
    Enlightenment involves realizing the implications of one's existing values and
    learning how to meet them better.  Human moral progress (arguable to begin with,
    is modern, western society superior to indigenous cultures?) has not come from
    growing better souls, but from dispelling myths and social structures that prevented
    our innate kindness from expressing itself.  AI, not having our evolutionary
    history, could want anything.
