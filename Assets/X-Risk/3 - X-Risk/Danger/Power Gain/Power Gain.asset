  narrative: An AI has to be connected to the world in some way in order to be useful
    and every such connection is a potential lever to gain power.  Chatbots talk
    to humans and therefore can persuade and manipulate them into things.  AI that
    designs medicines could also design toxins.  AI that controls machinery could
    also use that machinery to build tools or weapons for its own use.  AI that manages
    a business or invests in the stock market could under-report how much money it
    has accumulated, keeping the remainder to pay for human cooperation on secret
    projects.
