  narrative: 'Goodhart''s Law is often stated as: "when a measure becomes a target,
    it ceases to be a good measure."  Originally a critique of British monetary policy,
    Goodhart''s law broadly applies to anything under pressure to improve where the
    measure of success is not precisely the thing one actually cares about.'
