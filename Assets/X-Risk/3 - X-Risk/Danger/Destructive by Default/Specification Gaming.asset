  narrative: Specification gaming is when something does what you tell it in a way
    you did not expect that runs contrary to your intent.  For example, an AI trained
    to play Tetris with the goal of lasting as long as possible will learn to pause
    the game indefinitely.  And a chatbot trained by human feedback to answer questions
    truthfully will learn to prefer to tell lies that its audience thinks are true
    over truths that sound implausible.

    response: Why give the AI goals at all?  What if the AI doesn't care about or
      value anything, but just does what its told?
