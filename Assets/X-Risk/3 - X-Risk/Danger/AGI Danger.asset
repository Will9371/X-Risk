  narrative: Intelligence is the superpower that enabled humanity to dominate the
    world.  If an AI has significantly more intelligence than humanity, it can leverage
    that to rapidly gain an increasing share of the world's resources, technology,
    weapons, plans, and anything else that would give it power to impose its values
    on the world.  If those values are best satisfied in a world that doesn't include
    humans...no more us.
