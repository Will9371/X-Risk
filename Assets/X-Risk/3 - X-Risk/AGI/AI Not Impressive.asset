  narrative: We don't know enough about intelligence to say anything of the sort
    with confidence.  As AI systems have scaled up, new and surprising behvaiors
    have emerged, with new and surprising side-effects.  Superhuman AI could be close,
    or it could be a long ways off. It would be irresponsible to rely on a lucky
    roll of the dice we need to be prepared for all possibilities.
