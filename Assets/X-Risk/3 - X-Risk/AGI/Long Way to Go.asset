  narrative: We don't know enough about intelligence to say anything of the sort
    with confidence.  As AI systems have scaled up, new and surprising behvaiors
    have emerged, with new and surprising side-effects.  Superhuman AI could be close,
    or it could be a long ways off. It would be irresponsible to rely on a lucky
    roll of the dice we need to be prepared for all possibilities.  Besides, existing
    AI systems already raise important questions for society, such has the ethics
    of autonomous weapons and how to deal with mass unemployment.  We ought to be
    addressing these issues now, before making even more powerful systems with even
    bigger impacts.
