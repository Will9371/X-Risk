  narrative: This project is free, so the alternative would have been no art at all. 
    For my other projects, like Oscillarium, I am employing artists and musicians
    and paying them fairly.  But in general, yes, this is a big concern.  Even if
    there remains a place for human artists, a great deal of commercial art doesn't
    require the "human touch", meaning that there will be a lot fewer opportunities
    for a profession that is already being squeezed hard by economics.  And that's
    sad, because creating art is deeply fulfilling for many people and having it
    be financially sustainable allows them to engage their passion much more deeply.
