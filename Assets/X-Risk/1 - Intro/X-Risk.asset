  narrative: Just as an idea being in fiction doesn't make it true, an idea being
    in fiction doesn't make it false.  But more importantly, there are many ideas
    here that should all be considered independently.  Engage with the parts that
    interest you, skip over the rest, that's why I made this interactive.  But if
    you point to parts you think are silly to discredit parts that make you uncomfortable
    then you are an asshole.
