  m_Name: 1 - What is Bias
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  narrative: Of course!  But what does that mean?  Having opinions is not bias. 
    Bias is being systematically wrong in a predictable direction.  I try to minimize
    bias as much as possible, but I'm not perfect.  In particular, estimating personal
    certainty is hard, so the most likely kind of bias you will see here is overconfident
    opinions.
