  narrative: That's founding principle of some of the leading AI companies, including
    OpenAI and Anthropic.  The problem, at least in the case of OpenAI, continue
    to create ever more advanced systems while their current systems have vast unexplored
    potential for alignment research.  Also, it is not clear how well alignment scales
    from weaker to more powerful systems.
