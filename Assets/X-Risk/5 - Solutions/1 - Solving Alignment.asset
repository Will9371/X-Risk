  narrative: There are two core challenges with AI alignment.  The first is the technical
    challenge of instilling reliably human compatible values into an AI that stay
    aligned as the AI becomes more powerful.  The second is the social coordination
    challenge of ensuring that the technical challenge of AI alignment is solved
    before AI becomes powerful enough to cause trouble.
