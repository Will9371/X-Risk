  m_Name: How AI aligning AI works
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  narrative: The AI would generate proposals for alignment, which would be rated
    by (AI-assisted) human reviewers, which would serve as reinforcement to create
    better proposals.  This strategy is based on the assumptions that alignment is
    easier to evaluate than generate and that systems capable of generating necessary
    alignment insights won't be so powerful as to have already needed to be aligned
    themselves.
