  m_Name: What about China
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  narrative: Agh, so much wrong with this!  First, China is populated and run by
    humans--who also don't want the world to end.  Second, many of China's advancements
    in AI have come from copying the US, so the US slowing down also slows down China. 
    Third, the Chinese government may well want to regulate AI in order to control
    it.  Fourth, near-term disruption from totally unregulated AI could destablize
    the US to the point of actually giving China an advantage.  Fifth, the US has
    many major advantages, including access to hardware.  Sixth, redirecting research
    is not the same as stopping it altogether, and may not even be a disadvantage.
