  narrative: Alignment research needs to be significantly better funded.  Rather
    than relying on charities, grants, and side projects within AI companies, aligment
    needs to be a prerequisite for the public deployment of new AI systems so that
    companies have the incentive to direct resources towards ensuring their technology
    is reliable.
