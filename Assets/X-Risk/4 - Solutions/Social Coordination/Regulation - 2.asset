  narrative: The AI coordination problem is, at its heart, a democracy problem. 
    AI, and the values instilled into it, will affect everyone...but who gets to
    decide how it's built?  Right now, the answer is a very small number of people
    at high tech companies.  It doesn't have to be that way.  An informed and motivated
    public can put pressure on governments and corporations to shape policy that
    serves us all.  The first thing we have to overcome is the lie that we have no
    power.
