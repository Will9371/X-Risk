  narrative: What are you reacting to?  There aren't any proposals being considered
    for legislation yet!  Sure, there are many hypothetical regulations that could
    backfire or cause undesirable side effects that are worse than the problems they
    (fail to) solve, but there may also be ideas that make sense.  Now is the time
    for us to figure out what those are.
